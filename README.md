<h1 align="center">User Registration API with Conversion Ranking System</h1>

This project is an API developed in Node.js with TypeScript, using the Fastify framework. It allows user registration and generates a unique sharing link for each user. The API tracks clicks on these links and calculates how many new registrations were generated from them. Additionally, there is a ranking system that displays the top three users with the most conversions.
